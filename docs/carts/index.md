# Carts

In addition to a [product page]({% link docs/theme_architecture/templates.md %}), each experience on Easol has an automatically generated ['shop' page]({% link docs/carts/cart_shop.md %}), which can be found at `site.com/shop/product-slug`.

Within a theme you are also able to [display a customer's cart]({% link docs/carts/cart_display.md %}) and customer's to [interact with their cart]({% link docs/carts/cart_interactions/index.md %}) on site pages.
