# Customer terms pages
Creators are able to add customer terms to their site within their company settings. These are broken down into three key pages which are automatically generated at the following urls:

| Customer Terms        | Url                                  |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Payment Plan Terms    | site.com/terms/payment_plan_terms    |
| Terms and Conditions  | site.com/terms/terms_and_conditions  |
| Privacy Policy        | site.com/terms/privacy_policy        |

These are linked to from each Creator's checkout page.

You are not able to amend the html of terms pages, however any styles added to the [index.css]({% link docs/theme_architecture/assets.md %}) of a theme are also applied to the terms pages.
