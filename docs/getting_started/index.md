# Getting started

A theme controls the appearance and functionality of a Creator's site. 

Easol themes are built using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.

As a developer, you can [build a custom theme]({% link docs/getting_started/creating_a_theme.md %}#option-2-start-with-skeleton-theme) for a Creator or [customize an existing theme]({% link docs/getting_started/creating_a_theme.md %}#option-1-start-with-existing-easol-theme).
