# Theme architecture

A theme controls the appearance and functionality of a creator's site. 

Easol themes are built using [Liquid]({% link https://shopify.github.io/liquid/ %} templating language, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.

Theme code is organised within a [directory structure](% link docs/guides/theme_architecture/overview/index.md %) of files including templates, blocks and supporting assets such as images, stylesheets and scripts.
