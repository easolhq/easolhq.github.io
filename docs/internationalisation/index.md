# Internationalisation

Easol powers Creators globally. To support this, Easol enables Creators to sell in [multiple currencies]({% link docs/pricing_and_payments/currency_switcher.md %}) and has [built-in translation]({% link docs/internationalisation/localisation.md %}) on checkout pages.

Dates throughout creator sites are formatted by the [DatesHelper](https://github.com/easolhq/easol/blob/main/spec/helpers/dates_helper_spec.rb), based on the the users browser language.
