# Internationalisation

Easol powers Creators globally. To support this, Easol enables Creators to sell in [multiple currencies]({% link docs/pricing_and_payments/currency_switcher.md %}) and has [built-in translation]({% link docs/internationalisation/localisation.md %}) on checkout pages.

Dates throughout creator sites are formatted based on the the users browser language. For example, when set to `en-US` the day will succeed the month e.g. `January 1 2023`, rather than `1 January 2023`.
