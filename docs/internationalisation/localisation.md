# Localisation

The checkout pages on sites powered by Easol are available in the following languages. The language is automically set based on the customer's browser language preferences.

- British English
- American English
- German
- Spanish
- French
- Russian

However, we do not currently offer localised naming for Theme nomenclature, like block names, or block variable names. Easol themes are a single language, currently all English.

Wherever possible text that may be displayed in Sites should be Creator editable. For historic reasons Easol themes have some English copy and microcopy hardcoded but we recommend avoiding this wherever possible.
