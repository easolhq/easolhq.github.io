Our platform has built in localisation so Creators can use the platform in their native language. 

However, we do not currently offer localised naming for Theme nomenclature, like block names, or block variable names. Easol themes are built in a single language, currently all English.

Wherever possible text that may be displayed in Sites should be Creator editable. For historic reasons Easol themes have some English copy and microcopy hardcoded but we recommend avoiding this wherever possible.
