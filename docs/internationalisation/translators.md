The modern web experience has built in translation, with both desktop and mobile browsers prompting users to use built-in translators on page load. However, where creators wish to facilitate translation, we recommend Google's [GTranslate](https://support.easol.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4413760148881-Set-up-multi-language-website-with-GTranslate).

Unfortunately, due to the stages of template rendering, GTranslate doesn't reliably translate all content, particularly in the [cart shop]({% link docs/cart_shop/index.md %})
