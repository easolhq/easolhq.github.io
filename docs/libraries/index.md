# Libraries

## Included libraries
The below libraries are included on all Easol sites by default:
- Bootstrap v4.4.1 [(https://getbootstrap.com/)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- jQuery v3.6.1 [(https://jquery.com/)](https://jquery.com/)
- Font Awesome 4.7.0 [(https://fontawesome.com/)](https://fontawesome.com/)
- fixers_base - An additional stylesheet used for Easol [cart shops]({% link docs/cart_shop/index.md %}).

## Including additional libraries
Additional libraries can be included in the [header]({% link docs/site_navigation/index.md %}) or [footer]({% link docs/site_navigation/index.md %}) code on your theme. We recommend including these as fixed versions of cdn's.

> The Easol [cart shop]({% link docs/cart_shop/index.md %}) relies heavily on Bootstrap and core functionality may be affected if a later version of Bootstrap is included on a theme.
