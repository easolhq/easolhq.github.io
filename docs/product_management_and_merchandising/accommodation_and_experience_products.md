# Accommodation and experience products

Products are either an Experience or an Accommodation. The key difference is that Accommodations have a Daily Availability & Pricing feature. This feature expects what is being sold to be available across many dates, and that the customer should be able to choose check-in and check-out dates, perhaps with a minimum nights' stay.
