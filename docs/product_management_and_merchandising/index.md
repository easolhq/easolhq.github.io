# Product management and merchandising

## Product Management
Product Management in this context refers to configuring a Product so that it's optimised for sale. 

- Should car parking be an [Extra]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/extras.md %}) or a [Modifier]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/modifiers.md %})? 
- What are the benefits of managing a monthly event as a [Series]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/series.md %})?
- Should an event held at a boutique hotel be an [Accommodation or Experience]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/accommodation_and_experience_products.md %})?

As a Theme Developer, it's important to be aware of the variety of configurations Creators may have in place, and how to access and display this information.

## Product Merchandising
Product Merchandising refers to all the information that Creators may add, to better market their Experiences or Accommodations. 

Each Experience or Accommodation can have details added to:
- [Product Overview]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/product_overview.md %})
- [Variants]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/variants.md %})
- [Modifiers]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/modifiers.md %})
- [Merchandising]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/merchandising_fields.md %})
- [Useful info]({% link docs/product_management_and_merchandising/useful_info.md %})
