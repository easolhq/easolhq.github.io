# Useful info

Products can have details added to **Settings > Userful info**.

Any details added here are shown on Booking Confirmation emails as well as on tickets (only Experience type Products).

These can also be displayed on Sites. See [Useful info]({% link docs/reference/objects/product/useful_info.md %}).
