Some SEO considerations when developing an Easol theme:
- Canonical tags are added to the head of all pages, you don't need to worry about query parameters or pagination canibalising page results.
- Some [Metadata]({% link docs/seo/metadata.md %}) can be configured on individual site pages and is added to product pages. 
- Once a product (experience or accommodation) is published a merchandising page (/products/*) is automatically published and made available to search engines. The page cannot be unpublished without also unpublishing the product.
