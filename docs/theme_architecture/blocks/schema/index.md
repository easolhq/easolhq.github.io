# Schema

The block schema defines the [variables]({% link docs/theme_architecture/blocks/schema/variables/index.md %}) a Creator is able to use to customise the content of a block.

A block schema can also include an optional [layout]({% link docs/theme_architecture/blocks/schema/layout/index.md %}) section, which defines how the variables are displayed to the Creator within the Easol site builder.
