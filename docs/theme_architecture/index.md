# Theme architecture

A theme controls the appearance and functionality of a Creator's site. 

Easol themes are built using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.

Theme code is organised within a [directory structure]({% link docs/theme_architecture/directory_structure.md %}) of files including templates, blocks and supporting assets such as images, stylesheets and scripts.
